# Enhanced Location Marker Features

## Overview

Your React Native Maps app has been enhanced with orientation-aware location markers and Field of View (FOV) cone functionality, similar to Google Maps. The location marker now dynamically reflects device orientation using sensor data and displays a visual FOV cone indicating the direction the device is pointing.

## New Features

### üß≠ Orientation-Aware Marker Rotation

- **Real-time Device Orientation**: Uses `react-native-compass-heading` to get accurate compass readings
- **Smooth Rotation**: Marker rotates smoothly as you turn your device
- **GPS Fallback**: Falls back to GPS heading when compass is unavailable
- **360¬∞ Movement**: Handles full 360¬∞ rotation with proper wraparound

### üî¶ Field of View Cone

- **Google Maps-like Cone**: Semi-transparent cone showing device direction
- **Dynamic Rotation**: Cone rotates with device orientation
- **Customizable**: Adjustable angle, color, and opacity
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses native driver for 60fps performance

### üìç Enhanced Location Accuracy

- **Visual Accuracy Indicators**: Color-coded markers based on GPS accuracy
  - üéØ Blue: High accuracy (< 20m)
  - üìç Yellow: Moderate accuracy (20-50m)  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Red: Poor accuracy (> 50m)
- **Accuracy Ring**: Visual ring shows when accuracy is moderate/poor
- **Real-time Updates**: Heading display shows current bearing with compass indicator

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Throttled Updates**: Compass updates limited to prevent excessive re-renders
- **Native Animations**: All animations use native driver for smooth performance
- **Smart Smoothing**: Heading values are smoothed to prevent jittery movement
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Only updates when significant heading changes occur

## Components

### `EnhancedUserLocationMarker`

The main enhanced marker component with the following props:

```typescript
interface EnhancedUserLocationMarkerProps {
  coordinate: { latitude: number; longitude: number };
  heading: number;                    // GPS heading
  compassHeading?: number;            // Compass heading (preferred)
  isNavigating?: boolean;            // Show navigation animations
  showFOVCone?: boolean;             // Show/hide FOV cone
  fovAngle?: number;                 // FOV cone angle (default: 60¬∞)
  accuracy?: number;                 // GPS accuracy in meters
}
```

### `FieldOfViewCone`

Advanced FOV cone with SVG rendering:
- Gradient fill for realistic appearance
- Smooth rotation animations
- Configurable radius and angle

### `SimpleFieldOfViewCone`

Fallback FOV cone using View components:
- Simpler implementation for compatibility
- Good performance on older devices

## Hooks

### `useCompassHeading`

Manages device compass with advanced features:
- Smooth heading interpolation
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Performance optimizations
- Automatic lifecycle management

### Enhanced `useLocationTracking`

Updated to integrate compass data:
- Combines GPS and compass heading
- Prefers compass over GPS for better accuracy
- Manages both location and compass lifecycles

## Usage

The enhanced features are automatically enabled in your `NavigationMapScreen`. The marker will:

1. **Show FOV Cone**: Blue semi-transparent cone indicating device direction
2. **Rotate with Device**: Marker and cone rotate as you turn your phone
3. **Display Accuracy**: Color and indicators change based on GPS accuracy
4. **Show Heading**: Current bearing displayed below marker with compass indicator

## Configuration

You can customize the enhanced marker by modifying the props in `NavigationMapScreen.tsx`:

```typescript
<EnhancedUserLocationMarker
  coordinate={{ latitude: location.latitude, longitude: location.longitude }}
  heading={location.heading}
  compassHeading={location.compassHeading}
  isNavigating={navigationState.isNavigating}
  showFOVCone={true}        // Enable/disable FOV cone
  fovAngle={60}            // Cone angle in degrees
  accuracy={location.accuracy}
/>
```

## Performance Notes

- Compass updates are throttled to 100ms intervals
- Animations use native driver for 60fps performance
- Heading smoothing prevents jittery movement
- Only significant heading changes trigger updates

## Troubleshooting

### Compass Not Working
- Ensure device has magnetometer sensor
- Check device permissions for location/sensors
- Try calibrating device compass in settings

### Poor Performance
- Reduce compass update frequency in `useCompassHeading`
- Disable FOV cone on older devices
- Adjust throttling intervals in performance utils

### Inaccurate Heading
- Ensure device is held flat and away from metal objects
- GPS heading may be more accurate while moving
- Compass accuracy improves with device calibration

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
- `react-native-compass-heading` for device orientation
- `react-native-svg` for advanced FOV cone rendering
- React Native Animated API with native driver
- Custom performance utilities for throttling
- Smooth angle interpolation with 360¬∞ wraparound handling
